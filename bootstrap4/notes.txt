// Notes about Bootstrap4:


https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/migration/#global-changes

Switched from 
px to rem 
as our primary CSS unit, 
though pixels are still used for media queries and grid behavior as device viewports are not affected by type size.

// rem: relative to font-size of the 
// root element

Global font-size increased from 14px to 16px.

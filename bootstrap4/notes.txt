// Notes about Bootstrap4:


https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/migration/#global-changes

Switched from 
px to rem 
as our primary CSS unit, 
though pixels are still used for media queries and grid behavior as device viewports are not affected by type size.

// rem: relative to font-size of the 
// root element

Global font-size increased from 14px to 16px.

The classes are named using the format {property}{sides}-{size} for xs 
and {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, and xl.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/migration/#navbar

Responsive navbar behaviors are now applied to the .navbar class via the 
required 
.navbar-expand-{breakpoint} where you choose where to collapse the navbar. 
Previously this was a Less variable modification and required recompiling.

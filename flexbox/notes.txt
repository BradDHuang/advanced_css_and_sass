Flexbox:
    New module in CSS3
    that makes it easy to 
    align elements to one another,
    in different directions and orders.
    
    Give the container the ability to
    expand and to shrink elements
    to best use all the available space.
    
    Replaces float layouts,
    using lesss,
    and more readable and logical code.
    
    Changes the way that we build 
    one-dimensional layouts.
